Time taken:
Training:
Full dataset on local (puri): 35 minutes for 20 epochs, for each class, without regularization.
Regularization requires dense multiplication, not feasible on local.
Run in parallel on puri server (on 50 cores) so that it finishes in time.
Testing:
Full test dataset on local (puri): about 20 seconds
Full train dataset on local (puri): 4 minutes

2 types of testing: exact class set match or at least 1 correct class guessed:
